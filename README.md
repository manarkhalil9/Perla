# Perla 🦪

Perla is a personal planning web application that helps users transform long-term visions into clear monthly and daily actions within a calm, pearl-inspired environment.

The app combines goal setting, task management, and progress tracking to create a focused and motivating planning experience. Users receive a daily inspirational quote, organize their to-do list, build yearly visions, and visually monitor their progress through an interactive timeline.
